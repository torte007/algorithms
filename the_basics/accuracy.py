# To achieve higher accuracy, youâ€™ll need to rewrite your expressions.
# Consider, for example, the expression sqrt(x+1)-sqrt(x), where we assume that x is very big.
# The thing to do would be to get rid of the risky subtraction.
# By multiplying and dividing by sqrt(x+1)+sqrt(x), we end up
# with an expression that is mathematically equivalent to the original
# but where we have eliminated the subtraction: 1.0/(sqrt(x+1)+sqrt(x))
